# School Detection from Satellite Imagery

This repository contains the codebase for the weakly supervised object detection pipeline used to detect school buildings from satellite images, in the context of digital connectivity and infrastructure mapping. The approach relies on a large dataset of auto-labeled images and a smaller manually annotated set (golden data), with segmentation-based labeling, training, and fine-tuning strategies.
